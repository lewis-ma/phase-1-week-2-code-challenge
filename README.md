//Flataculties
This is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a backend server using JSON-server, which allows users to vote for their favorite animal among a list of 5 characters. The table displays the animals' ID, name, picture, and number of votes. Users can also add new animals to the list and reset the vote counts to zero.
